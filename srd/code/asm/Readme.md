Initial Commits contain the SPRR Code by Sven Peter for M1 Apple Silicon. The Code is being refactored for iOS. 

Also available is a TFTP Server ripped and canabalized for the SRD. TFTP Server & Client work perfectly for iOS 14.3 -> 14Beta7.

## iPhone 11 Register Fuzzing Code

On May 6, 2021 a Post by Sven Peter about Apple Silicon Hardware Secrets: SPRR and Guarded Exception Levels (GXF) at URL https://blog.svenpeter.dev/posts/m1_sprr_gxf/ appeared in my Timeline. I had just been reviewing https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1/blob/main/tools/apple_regs.json.

For the M1 Apple Silicon Platform, I've Posted some Results at URL https://github.com/xsscx/macos-research/tree/main/sprr
