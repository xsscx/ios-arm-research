Please contribute Code and Knowledge into the Public Domain.

The Code is CopyPasta from Sven Peter and I'm in the process of (slowly) refactoring the Code for iOS and the SRD. If you have ideas, or Code, and want to help get results, please make a PR, Issue or Discussion.

Note - I'm in learning mode, not a ninja. Your _input_ is requested.

Thank You
