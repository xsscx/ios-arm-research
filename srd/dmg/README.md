# Example DMG Files to side-load on Cryptex File System for Apple Security Research Device
-----------
Cryptex with Working code examples already Compiled, Signed and Hand-Rolled with Care into a precious cryptex for your consumption. Also included is debugserver with the signed entitlement and other goodies to you get thinking.

Example DMG's for multiple Toolchains and iOS Flavors...

How do it work?

If you have read the Makefile and Documentation then you can download the dmg and put it in ../example-cryptex/ and use it. I'll Post a How-to here and on https://srd.cx with look at hand-rolling a cryptex, but, its very easy.. just look at the example in the Makefile.. this DMG has Toybox Unstripped for Debugging.. Its critical to have the Unstripped.. how can you see anything??? (cough).

So rip out the code and then start hand-rolling, or just wait for my CopyPasta Instructions... here is a sample..
```
uname -a
Darwin iPhone 20.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.6.0: Sun Jun 20 22:50:32 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.140.39.0.1~13/RELEASE_ARM64_T8030 iPhone12,1
```
This is where I'm dropping you at in the Build Pipeline:
```
created: /Users/dhoyt/srd/share/security-research-device/example-cryptex/com.example.cryptex.dmg
```
Now you have this DMG, lets walk thru the hand-roll and smoke our fine cryptex.... 

This is how the Makefile does it.. no magic.. follow along.. if you get it.. cool.. but if not, Open an Issue, ping me on Slack, hit me up on Twitter.. this is a critical hurdle to get over...

Next Steps:
```
cryptexctl uninstall com.example.cryptex 
```
```
hdiutil create -fs hfs+ -srcfolder com.example.cryptex.dstroot/ com.example.cryptex.dmg  
```
```
...................................................
created: /Users/dhoyt/srd/share/security-research-device/example-cryptex/com.example.cryptex.dmg
```
```
cryptexctl ${CRYPTEXCTL_FLAGS} create --replace ${CRYPTEXCTL_CREATE_FLAGS} -i com.example.cryptex -v H.O.Y.T com.example.cryptex.dmg
```
```
cryptexctl install com.example.cryptex.cptx 
```
```
cryptexctl list                            
com.example.cryptex
  version = H.O.Y.T
  device = /dev/disk2s1
  mount point = /private/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/mnt/com.example.cryptex.bAa5aS
```
